# Note taking app

This app uses Express.js to write/create, read/get, and remove/delete data from a table.

The front end has been provided and is not my own code. 

The routes are in both the server.js file and the routes folder.


TO USE:

open app and start to type. There will be a floppy disc icon in the top right section when you are able to save the NEW note.
To view notes you have to click on it from the left side, allowing you to see the title and body of the note creates.

When you no longer need to view the note you can click the plus button to add a new note. Or you can delete the note with the trash can icon.
